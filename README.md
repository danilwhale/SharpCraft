### voxel game (yet another minecraft clone) on raylib (5.0) and c# (.net 8)

project won't evolve on minecraft branch anymore, I will add content that I want.
just copying existing game on different tools isn't that interesting, is it?

## found a bug?
please report it in issues!!!!!!!

## known bugs
idk

## how to get the latest version??????
[click here to go to GitHub actions](https://github.com/danilwhale/SharpCraft/actions/),
then select top most link with checkmark from the left, click on it,
scroll down, download artifact for your platform (windows or linux)

> ⚠️ linux build is untested, if not working, build it yourself using the instructions in 'how to build' section

## how to build
1. clone repo (using download button, git clone or ide's vcs clone system)
2. open project in any ide you want
   - in case you don't have any ide, open project's folder in command prompt
3. build it!
   - no ide? `dotnet build` inside project's folder
