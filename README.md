### clone of minecraft, but on raylib (5.0) and c# (.net 8)

found a bug? please, report it in issues!!!!!!!
I need to polish base game, so it will be easier to update this clone
to newer versions (at least to last pre-classic version lmao)

## todo
- [ ] fix flashing chunks on block placing/removing
- [ ] refactor code a lot
- [ ] make github actions work (build for linux and windows)

## how to build™
1. clone repo (using download button, git clone or ide's vcs clone system)
2. open project in any ide you want
   - in case you don't have any ide, open project's folder in command prompt
3. build it!
   - no ide? dotnet build inside project's folder
